PACKAGE CONTENTS:
   README	This file.
   LICENSE	Details of the license that applies to this package.
   A2TOOLS.EXE  MS-DOS executable program.
   manual.dos   User's manual for the DOS version.
   a2tools.6    User's manual for the UNIX version, in manpage format.
   a2tools.c    Source program that should compile automatically on any
		MS-DOS or UNIX ANSI C compiler.
   install.csh  C-shell script for easy UNIX installation.
		(Inspect before running it.)

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:
   MS-DOS and UNIX.  The source is in ANSI C, and should compile properly
   on both platforms.

UNIX/Linux INSTALLATION:
   Review the shell script "install.csh" and make any changes appropriate 
   for your system. $BINDIR is the directory where the executable program 
   will end up;  $MANDIR/man6 is the directory where the manual page will
   end  up.  The  symbolic  links  are  necessary  -  the program behaves 
   differently  depending  on  what  name  it  is  called as, and thus is 
   equivalent to having several different programs.   See the manual page 
   for details.
   
   Running "install.csh"  will compile the program and install it on your
   system, ready for use.

DOS INSTALLATION:
   A prebuilt executable is furnished in this package.  Renaming it to an
   acceptable short name is recommended.

   Optionally,  the  source  program  may  be  compiled  with  any ANSI C
   compiler.
